   <p style="font-family:Garamond, serif;">The buildings all small and nice greenery from above. After some time, we were served food. My mother helped us have the food and we enjoyed the food. We made friends in the plane and had some nice time chatting with them. I played games and watched my favourite cartoon shows. After some time I slept and took rest for some time. By the time I woke up, it was almost time to reach. I saw the oceans below us and when were nearing lands, it was a beautiful site. I enjoyed watching all this beautiful scenery from my window and finally. </p>
